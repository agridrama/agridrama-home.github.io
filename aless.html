The Relationship Between Social Media and Reading Habits
Kazuki CHADA
Abstract
Social media is widespread. There are a lot of famous social media, such as Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube. Those media are part of students' daily lives and, in the era of social media, students felt they could not read enough because of social media. A former study suggested that the reading time of undergraduate students was decreasing. This study aimed at revealing the relationship between the reading habits of students and social media focused on their categories. The research was conducted through the questionnaire survey for undergraduate students about their social media usage and their reading time and frequency. The first five questions were about how participants used three social media, Twitter, Instagram, and video watching services. The last five questions were about reading time and frequency. The results might display a tendency to decline the frequency of reading compared to participants’ previous one and the current reading frequency had a weak relationship with the past frequency. In spite of the feelings of students, the results might not imply the correlation between social media usage and reading habits. Also, there was no correlation between the investigated social media categories and reading habits. Therefore, those outcomes indicated the existence of other factors that made the students feel social media prevented them from reading and the needs of the extensive range of tracking surveys on the students' daily lives.

Introduction
In the last fifteen years from 2021, more and more people have used various kinds of social media. Twitter, one of the most famous social media apps, started its service in 2006 in Japan and other famous social media also launched during this period. YouTube, Facebook, Line, and Instagram started their service in 2007 to 2011 in Japan. People in 10s and 20s years old, especially, used the internet more than four hours a day on average in 2020 (Institute for Information and Communications Policy, 2021). 
The university students read less and the average time per day was 30 minutes in 2018 (Sawasaki, 2020). The Japanese language division of the Agency for Cultural Affairs (2019) reported that 73.5% of people aged 16 to 19 who felt they read less than before thought the reason was that they were spending too much time on digital devices.  These facts might imply that the time university students spend reading books is decreasing because of the usage of the internet. However, The report of the National Federation of University Co-operative Associations (2020) examined the students' reading habits and concluded that there was no relationship between the survey year and the average amount of reading. 10s and 20s years people read more text on the internet. They spent about one hour a day reading some text content (email, blog, and website) on the internet (IICP, 2021, pp. 29-34). Internet usage and reading text might not be a simple trade-off relationship.
Furthermore, the internet and social media include various contents and can be used for many purposes. Smith (2017) gave one way to categorize social media into 11 groups by their characteristic for undergraduate learning. For example, Twitter is categorized as microblogs, YouTube as video sharing, Instagram as Image Sharing. However, the former surveys about university students’ social media and reading habits, (Kojo, Agyekum & Arthur, 2018 and Rafiq, Asim, Khan & Arif, 2019) did not give much consideration to the relationship between types of social media and reading habits. 
Consequently, the purpose of this study is to reveal the relationship between social media types and reading habits focused on social media types. Three different social media and categories were chosen from the survey of  Smith (2017). They were Twitter which represents the category of microblogs and social networking, Instagram as the Image sharing social media and video sharing media such as YouTube, TikTok and other video streaming services. Examining the relationship between social media types and the reading habits of university students could give a better understanding of students’ reading habits.
This research was conducted on a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was answered and collected via Google Form. The participants were students of the University of Tokyo. The questions were about their social media usage and reading habits. The participants were asked to answer their post and usage time of 3 different kinds of social media, Twitter, Instagram, and video streaming services (YouTube, TikTok, Amazon Prime Video, etc.) and their past and present reading habits. The answers to each question were analyzed and the indices of social media usage and reading habits were compared. 
Methods
1.	Participants
25 participants answered the survey. They were undergraduate students from the University of Tokyo. 17 were male, 7 were female and 1 was other or not answered. Their average age was 18.96 (SD = 0.89) and with an age range of 18 to 21. Consent was obtained from participants using a consent form.
2.	Procedure
Participants answered the questionnaire on Google Forms to collect data about their social media usage and reading habits.  
3.	Questionnaire
In the questionnaire, there were 10 questions about social media usage and reading habits.  Five questions regarding social media usage were revised from the survey of Okamoto (2017). The other five questions regarding reading habits were revised versions of questions from the paper of Sawasaki (2020).  The questions were as follows:
Q1. The time you use Twitter in a week.
__ hours __ minutes __ seconds 
Q2. How many times do you post on Twitter per week? 
Q3. The time you use Instagram in a week.
__ hours __ minutes __ seconds 
Q4. How many times do you post on Instagram per week? (including story post)
Q5. The time you use video streaming services (YouTube, TikTok, Amazon Prime Video, etc...) per week.
__ hours __ minutes __ seconds 
Q6. How often did you read books and newspapers except for school textbooks when you were elementary, junior high and high school students? 
Q7.  How often do you usually read textbook and extracurricular books, newspapers and web novels?
Q8. How many hours do you spend on reading textbooks and books related to the course per week?
＿＿＿ hours per a week
Q9. How many hours do you spend on extracurricular reading books per week?
＿＿＿ hours per a week
Q10. How many hours do you spend on reading newspapers or web news articles?
＿＿＿ hours per a week
Participants answered Q6 and 7 by choosing from seven scales, which were 
1 never, 2, 3 sometimes, 4, 5 once a week, 6, 7 every day.
4.	Data Analysis
The results were analyzed by Microsoft Excel and R. The answers of Q1,3,5 which asked about the period of time they used social media, were converted to minutes. The results of Q6 and Q7 were applied to the score of 1 to 7 depending on the degree they chose.  The score 7 was the most often they read the books, and 1 was the least. The total social media usage time was the sum of Q1,3,5. The total reading time was the sum of Q8,9,10. The subjects were divided into three groups with a k-means algorithm applied to the normalized social media usage time data.
Results
	25 answers were collected through the survey. One of 25 participants answered that he used Instagram for 1 minute per week and posted 21 posts in the survey. This data was excluded from the results. Thus, 24 data were used in examining the result. When the value of R-squared was between 0.2 and 0.5, a weak correlation was assumed to exist. When the value of R-squared was higher than 0.5, a strong correlation was assumed to exist.
1.	Linear correlation between social media usage and reading habits
There was no correlation found between particular social media types and students’ reading habits (Figure 1) and between total social media usage time and students’ reading time (Figure 2).  The students’ current reading frequency and each social media usage time had a negative correlation, but all of the R-squared was less than 0.2.

2.	Results of Social media usage
23 participants answered that they used social media more than 1 minute per week and only one participant did not use any of the three social media. The average total usage time per week was 1075 minutes (SD = 717). The most used social media was video watching service (M = 795, SD = 599) second was Twitter (M = 193, SD = 215) and the least was Instagram (M = 87, SD = 126). The video watching service was in proportion to 74.0% of total social media usage time on average (Figure 3). The second category is Twitter, in proportion to 18%.

3.	Results of reading habits
16 participants were less often reading compared to when they were elementary to high school students. However, the decrease of degree was low (M = -1.08 points, SD = 1.74). There was a weak correlation (R-square value = 0.244) between the past reading frequency and current reading frequency (Figure 4).

4.	Clustering by social media usage
In order to examine the relationship between social media usage and reading habits, the participants were divided into three groups. The k-means clustering method was applied to the normalized social media usage time data. Group 1 had 11 subjects, group 2 had 10 subjects and group 3 had three subjects. The average of total reading time of group 1,2 and 3 was 10.1 (SD = 4.7), 7.2 (SD = 6.8) and 6.5 (SD = 3.0) hours. The difference of average among the group did not statistically exist (p > 0.05).
 Fig 5. The left figure was about the scatter plot by subjects’ social media usage time data and results of k-means clustering. The x and y-axis were the first and second principal components from the results of principal components analysis. The right figure was about the total reading time per week distribution of each group of subjects.

Discussion
The aim of this research was to reveal the relationship between social media types and the reading habits of students.  In this research, we could not find any correlation between these two factors. Furthermore, the total social media usage time and reading habits also seemed to have no correlation. The result might mean that spending time on social media at one period of time is not directly related to the reading habits of that period. 
The Japanese language division of the Agency for Cultural Affairs (2019) conducted a survey on the reading habits of Japanese. It reported that 73.5% of people aged 16 to 19 had the feeling that students read less than before due to the overuse of digital devices. Though there was a difference between overuse of digital devices and spending time on social media, this former result was not able to be supported by our study. 
According to the answer about social media usage, the most used social media was video streaming and watching service and its proportion was about 74% and the average daily usage time was 113 minutes per day. The survey of IICP (2021) has reported that the average usage time of video watching services was 122 minutes per day. Thus, our results about video watching services most agree with the survey of IICP(2021).
	The outcomes about the reading habits of students were hard to compare to the former surveys because the questionnaires and criteria were different and sometimes the definition of ‘reading time’ was ambiguous. To make this point clear, This survey divided the reading into three groups, curriculum-related books, extracurricular books and news, according to Sawasaki(2020). The result might suggest that university students tended to decline the frequency of reading compared to when they were elementary, junior high and high school students, and the average total reading time was about one hour and twelve minutes. Results from our study showed that the current reading frequency of students was slightly higher than the result of Sawaski (2020), but the past frequency and average reading time were almost the same for Sawasaki (2020). NFUCA (2020) also reported the average reading time per day of university students was 30 minutes, which was half of our results. However, they asked ‘the average time of reading books (includes ebooks) per day and this is different from the way Sawaski(2020) and this survey asked, the naive comparison was inappropriate.  This is a limitation to our study. 
In addition to the above limitation, this study had another three limitations. The first limitation was the number of subjects. Group 3 of the clustering had only three subjects. When the number of subjects is small, the statistical analysis was hard to apply to them and the error could be larger than the time when there was sufficient data. The other limitation was that we could not track social media usage and reading habits along the time. Like the weak correlation between past and current reading frequency, one’s current situation and habits were continuous from the past. Even if there seemed no correlation between the factors, the factors of the past might correlate with the current factors. The last limitation was that the university students spend their free time not only on social media and reading but also on club activities and temporary jobs. Therefore, these two factors might be in a more complex relationship than a simple trade-off relationship. Some students might spend most of their time on circle and club activities, other students do temporary jobs.  For future questions, not only the social media use and reading but also other daily activities should be asked and analyzed, and more answers should be gathered.
For future studies, we should think about the effect of other time spending factors as we mentioned above. Also, we might consider the reason why many students and people felt social media usage was the reason for decreasing the reading time. 
This study was important for two reasons. At first, this survey focused on the types of social media. Social media had various contents and features so that the correlation of other factors sometimes could not be found. Categorizing social media and limiting the scale and possible function, the hypothesis could be easily tested and reduce the effect of unexpected and unrecognized elements. Second, this survey analyzed the relationship between students’ social media usage and reading habits in a quantitative aspect. Most surveys asked and analyzed how participants think or feel about social media or reading habits, like Kojo et al. (2018) and the Japanese language division of Agency for Cultural Affairs, Japan(2020). However, these kinds of questions might give students wrong assumptions or too simple ideas of the relationship and have the possibility of distorting the outcomes. In conclusion, this survey might imply social media usage was not the direct cause of the reduction of reading frequency and time.
